# Data Warehouse
#### _Using Amazon Redshift_

## Project Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, we are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Description
In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, we will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Project Datasets
We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
- Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

#### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```sh
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

 And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
 
```sh
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

```sh
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and event datasets, we'll need to load them into staging tables first before we create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table
_`songplays` - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong_
* songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
_`users` - users in the app_
* user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

_`songs` - songs in music database_
* song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

_`artists` - artists in music database_
* artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

_`time` - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units_
* start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## How to run the python scripts
1. You need to creat IAM user, then create a redshift cluster. 
    * For creating IAM role, getting ARN and running cluster, you can use [This Notebook](https://github.com/FatmaElboshy/udacity_aws_IaC/tree/main). 
2. Get the `Endpoint` and `ARN` values from the refered notebook and add them to `Host` and `ARN` fields in the ```dwh.cfg``` file.
3. Run in the Terminal/CMD the following commands: 
    * Note: Make sure you are in the same directory
    
    ```sh
    python create_tables.py
    python etl.py
    ```
